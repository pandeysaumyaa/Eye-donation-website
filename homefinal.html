   <h3>Inji Bai & Kallu's story</h3>
    <p>A few months back, Inju started having blurred vision in her right eye. She also developed sensitivity towards light. She started to recall Kalluâ€™s slow loss of his left eyeâ€™s vision a few years ago, when he was dealing with a similar problem. At the time, they had been really worried and unclear of what to do, but Kallu had been fortunate to find someone who had organised an eye screening camp for cost free. After being told he had cataract, Kallu underwent surgery without having to pay for it out of his pocket, which was a huge relief for him. Inji was experiencing the same problems that Kallu had encountered.</p>

    <h3>"That was amit, he always wanted to help people"</h3>
    <p>Saturday, May 7, marks exactly five years since a remarkable young man passed away. Russell Beasley battled a rare genetic illness until his death at just 20 years of age. However, his kindness, selflessness, and desire to help others continues to make an immeasurable difference in peopleâ€™s lives every day.

For those who knew him, the memories of an outgoing, good, generous and kind person are still very much alive. â€œHe never met a stranger â€” even as a little boy,â€ says his mother, Sherri Dalton. â€œHe was funny and liked joking around. He was quick witted and even a little mischievous. But he cared about everyone.â€
